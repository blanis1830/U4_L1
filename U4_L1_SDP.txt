self.__stack and self.__size are private variables. Remember that private variables are only allowed to be accessed INSIDE the class itself. 
Why is it important that these variables are private?
  Ensures that they cant be modified outside the class, by keeping them private we maintain control over the stack and prevents accidental modifications


The __is_empty() method is private so it is designed to only be used inside the class. Where should we use this method? Explain your reasoning.
  Used inside the pop and top classes, we avoid duplicating the same condition in multiple methods. It also reflects empty logic check across the entire class.


When designing data structures, it is often important that the class is designed to raise errors in certain circumstances. 
This is different from designing resources for the average user where the user should never see an error message. 
Why is it important that we raise errors in the resources that we design for a programmer to use?
  It gives clear feedback when the data structure is being used incorrectly. Errors help identify problems early in development.


When we use an array (list) as the basis of our stack, we set things up so that the top of the stack is the end of the list. 
Why is this more efficient than setting the top to the front of the list? Use measures of complexity and big-o notation in your response.
  By using the end of list as the top of the stack, we improve performance and it has a time complexity of O(1), whilst removing at the top is O(n).


Google the term “unit testing”. Summarize the definition/description here. How is unit testing incorporated in this lab? 
Why is it important to this assignment?
  Unit testing is the process of testing individual components or functions of a program to ensure they work as intended
  We use it for our test in main.py, with pop, top, and push
  It helps catch bugs in our code early, and ensures changes in code don't introduce more errors
